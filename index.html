I have added in the tags on the pages after the fact but I am still frustrated at this blunder. -->

Regardless I wanted to find out how to create the effect and came across an example from https://jsfiddle.net/dustinkerstein/65v7pkna/ that will be useful when working on the finished project. What I could do in HTML however was adding in elements to make the video autoplay muted and be in a constant loop -->

                <!-- NOTES: For the placeholder video I chose a fan recreation of the original trailer of the game from 2003 (by 'Steven Reviews'), but I needed to optimize the video for the web, which I needed to find the best method as to how. Handbrake is an effective application to optimize the file, but because the video was over 1min30sec, it complicates things. Videos that serve as hero/background content should be kept short, something no longer then 15-20 seconds (Masuga, 2022) So I trimmed down the video to help optimize the media, but since this is a placeholder, I will develop a more refined version for the final site

        <!-- NOTES: Validating the webpages is integral towards the functionality of the website, and over the weeks an error regarding <section> tags, inside <article> tags which displays the issue, "Article lacks heading, consider using H2-H6 elemens to add identifying headings to all articles", initially applying a aria element solves the issue but with prior knowledge from validating the weekly tutorials, I wanted to look further into the issue before validating. I came across infomation from the fourms of freeCodeCamp.org (2022) that outlines the difference between aritcles and sections. An article is standalone, wheras a section groups content thematically related to eachother. So I assigned the respective content of each page to either respective groups of info <section>, or a indiviual piece of infomation if relevent <article>.
