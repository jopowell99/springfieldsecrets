                                <p>After the initial tutorial mission, the first real mission awaits! To complete this make good use of the various shortcuts from the house to the school, drive through the blue building just in front of the house and over the fire truck ladder next to the Kwik-E-Mart to secure an easy victory. If you are struggling, use the One Hit Wreck cheat and bump into Skinner, his car will be destroyed but the race continues.  </p>

                                <p>Even though there is a generous amount of time to complete the mission, make sure to drive safely as crashing the vehicle can cause setbacks. Also keep in that entering in and out of the vehicle will occur a couple of times, so make sure to place the vehicle in an easy to reach spot when exiting. When reaching the family portrait objective, cut through the cemetary to save time and avoid oncoming traffic. </p>

                                <p>The required vehicle for the mission is not mandatory and you have the option to select a different vehicle, but the Plow King is very effective albiet a little slow. The one thing you need to focus on is maintaining enough speed to catch up to Smithers and cause damage, an effective way to do this is to veer him into a tree or wall where he will remain stuck until he can drive back out. </p>

                                <p>Vehicles are not needed as the mission takes place entirely inside the Power Plant. Keep an eye on where you are jumping and the timing of the various platforms that move you around. You can be risky by double jumping through a couple of them to save time but if you have enough time, it isnt viable as falling requires you to run back to the platform that takes you back up.  </p>

                                <p>Before starting the missions, switch the Plow King to a different vehicle as the slow speed is going to make the mission more difficult. It is also     important to keep the Black Van in good condition as much as your own vehicle, otherwise the mission will fail and you have to restart. Be careful where you are going and watch out for traffic aswell to prevent collision and losing the van's tail. </p>

                                <p>The Hit and Run meter will be your biggest challenge, as hitting too many objects will send the police on you, since you will be staying behind the truck hitting it occassionally and collecting the items, make sure to keep enough distance and awareness on where the items drop. The provided vehicle (Canyonaro) will make the mission more effective with decent handling and speed (we will be seeing it again in Level 4). </p>

                                <p>Before you talk to Carl, effectivley starting the mission, make sure the car is lined up to face the opposite way of the power plant, with enough distance for you to get in the vehicle as soon as the mission starts as Smithers will be driving, Similar to the opening mission make good use of the shortcuts you have picked up on from driving around and utilise a effective vehicle (If you have been following the collectables guide, the Electric Car provided from completing the three races in level 1 is very effective). </p>

                <!-- NOTES (26/04/24): JavaScript is something that isnt getting focused on during our weekly activites / lectures, but with the case of the 'Level 1 Missions' page, there are 2 nav bars (as I went over during the project proposal). The idea was for CSS to make it a fixed element as the user scrolls so they could select a specific mission, but making it fixed with padding or margins creates problems, the code from W3Schools (n.d) provided a solution that involved JavaScript to allow the nav bar to appear on screen after scrolling around 20 or so pixels down. 

                Since it was JavaScript, I wasnt sure where exactly it would sit, either similar to CSS with it's own document, or somewhere in either the HTML or CSS files. A decent answer was provided from a different weekly workshop activity from Simmons University (n.d) that says to place a <script> tag between <head> tags or just before closing the <body> tag. It is placed there to help reduce page loading times. (Not sure why the university workshop slides are avaliable online but I will take it)
