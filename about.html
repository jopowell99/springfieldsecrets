                                    <h2>Who are the Developers?</h2>
                                    <p>The developer <strong>Radical Entertainment</strong> received the rights to create games for The Simpsons franchise after demonstrating a playable prototype. They had previously released The Simpsons: Road Rage in 2001 but decided to steer the franchise's video game series in a different direction with Hit &amp; Run. <br><br> The development team consisted of around 60 people and was led by producer Vlad Ceraldi, designer Joe McGinn, and artist Yayoi Maruno-Chorney. They collaborated with the show's writers and cast to craft the story and dialogue, taking inspiration from the Grand Theft Auto series for the open-world design and nuanced character development.<br><br> Radical Entertainment has also developed classic titles such as Destiny and the Prototype Series.</p>

                    <!-- NOTES: As I was making validations to my pages, I stumbled across an error in the Aside article and the unordered list. "Element img not allowed as child of element ul in this context. (Suppressing further errors from this subtree.)". I found out from a WikiHow (2023) article that details how to add images to a list, that the image code needs to be applied into the <li> tag in order for the error to be solved.
